# The Album App #

By Darlingside

A visually immersive, mobile-friendly web app for accompanying a musical album--with streaming audio, related videos, lyrics, liner notes, and other related content. Also my first open source project.

Live demo: <a href='http://www.pilotmachines.com/'>Darlingside - Pilot Machines</a>

Uses JPlayer, Handlebars, and Supersized.
